Schedules repeating posts.

== Description ==

In short, schedules repeating posts for future publishing.

Allows admins to take an existing post (aka template), and create clones of it for future publication.  This is helpful for mass communication blogs which have recurring events or regularly scheduled announcements.

For example, a book club blog could have a post titled - "Team Leaders' Monthly Meeting".  In just one click, the admin could schedule a clone of that post to run every 30 days from January through December.

After installing, find your post template, click on edit and **scroll to the very bottom of the edit post page** to find Repeating Post.

== Installation ==

1. Upload files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can the posts be customized? =

Currently, no.  The plugin creates exact copies of the post.

However, since the posts are scheduled to be published in advance, you can then just customize future posts by editing them.

== Screenshots ==

1. Scoll to the bottom of the edit post page to get to repeating post

2. Date picker!  You picker you!

Now works with custom post types

For events (custom post type):

* Ability to publish post immediately - allows you to announce the event right away, even though the event is in the future
* Updates a custom meta field - custom_date - but need to generalize this somehow for other plugins.
