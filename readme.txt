Schedules repeating posts.

== Description ==

In short, schedules repeating posts for future publishing.

Allows admins to take an existing post (aka template), and create clones of it for future publication.  This is helpful for mass communication blogs which have recurring events or regularly scheduled announcements.

For example, a book club blog could have a post titled - "Team Leaders' Monthly Meeting".  In just one click, the admin could schedule a clone of that post to run every 30 days from January through December.

== Installation ==

1. Upload files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can the posts be customized? =

Currently, no.  The plugin creates exact copies of the post.

However, since the posts are scheduled to be published in advance, you can then just customize future posts by editing them.
